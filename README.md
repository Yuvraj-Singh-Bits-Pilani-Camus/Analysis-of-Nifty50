# Project Title : Analysis-of-NIFTY50

## Project Overview:
The NIFTY50 index is a benchmark stock market index representing the top 50 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. This project analyzes historical data of the NIFTY50 index from 2000 to 2021, aiming to derive meaningful insights into market trends, volatility, and the performance of key sectors over time. 

## Dataset Used:
The dataset, publicly available on Kaggle and uploaded by user Vopani, contains comprehensive company-level data for the NIFTY50 index spanning 2000 to 2021. The dataset is available as a compressed file, "Dataset.rar," in this repository, which includes:

1) "NIFTY50_all": A CSV file containing the complete data for the years 2000-2021.
2) "stock_market": A folder with 50 CSV files, each containing individual company data for the same period.
3) "stock_metadata": A CSV file containing metadata for each company.

##  Data Analysis 
This project examines sector-wise and company-level performance during key economic phases (2000-2021) using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Sector-level insights highlight the resilience of various sectors during crises and their growth potential during recovery phases. Company-level analysis uncovers performance correlations and identifies the most profitable companies in alignment with macroeconomic trends. These findings offer valuable guidance for strategic investment decisions, balancing risk and return across sectors and phases.
